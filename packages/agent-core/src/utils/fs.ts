 * Low-level POSIX durability primitives.
 *
 * Two concerns that every durable write must handle:
 *   1. file *contents* — solved by `fh.sync()` after the write
 *   2. directory *entries* — solved by opening the parent directory and
 *      calling `fh.sync()` on the directory handle
 *
 * `fh.sync()` on a file does NOT guarantee that the directory entry
 * pointing at that file has been committed. On POSIX a crash between
 * the file-content fsync and the parent-directory fsync can leave the
 * file's bytes on disk with no visible name. The primary durable path
 * is POSIX; Windows is best-effort — NTFS's MoveFileEx commits the
 * dirent inside the file fsync, so a separate directory fsync is a
 * no-op (and EISDIR-fails on `open(dir, 'r')`).

 *   3. rename(tmp, target) — atomic on POSIX.
